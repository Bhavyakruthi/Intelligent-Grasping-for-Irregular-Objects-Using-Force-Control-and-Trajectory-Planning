# Intelligent-Grasping-for-Irregular-Objects-Using-Force-Control-and-Trajectory-Planning
This project focuses on optimizing robotic grasping of spherical objects using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) in a simulated environment with the Franka Emika Panda robotic arm. 
The primary objective is to identify optimal antipodal grasp points on spherical objects, ensuring force closure and stable grasping within the gripper's constraints. 
The methodology integrates ADMM for grasp point selection, inverse kinematics for precise gripper positioning, and Proportional-Derivative (PD) control for smooth trajectory execution in the PyBullet simulation platform. 
A Finite State Machine (FSM) orchestrates the robot's movement through distinct phases: approach, grasp, transport, and release. 
Results demonstrate successful grasping with a grasp distance of 0.054 meters and a force closure dot product of 1.0, indicating robust stability. 
The simulation highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with potential applications in automated pick-and-place systems. 
Future work aims to extend the methodology to non-spherical objects and real-world hardware implementations.
